			Hey folks,whats up ! Welcome to my Scan-and-Pay App built using Expo CLI. I learned React-Native by building this simple app and it was really a great fun ! 

			Tools used :
				* Frontend : React-Native (expo cli^ 3.0.9)
				* Backend  : PHP and Node.js^ 10.14.1 

			Steps to run this Application :

			* Clone this repository.
			* Enter the following Commands :
			    > cd scan-and-pay
			    > npm install
			    > node paypal.js -->This is the Server for Payments
			* Then ,Open new terminal tab , navigate into the scan-and-pay folder and hit "npm start".
			* A browser window pops up at > localhost:19002/
			* Click on tunnel and then scan the QR-Code on the Expo App(You can download that app from PlayStore).
			* Wooah ! See it in action .


		    This is a very basic project through which I learned React-Native. Through this app users can scan the barcode of products in a departmental store or where ever they want and send the total price to the Shop owner. I used PayPal's Payment Gateway . You can change it if you want . I  tested the app in development environment and it works perfectly .    

			As a Backend developer I didn't consider UI more deeply, so please bear with the UI ... You add more functionalities and take this one to the next level ...Keep Learning ! Kudos !
